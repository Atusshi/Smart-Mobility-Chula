Software-defined wireless mesh network (SDWMN) is developed and installed on Phayathai road in front of Chulalongkorn University for sending traffic image to two traffic police boxes. The system consists of 6 Raspberry Pi nodes (PI1 â€“ PI6) equipped with a camera that is installed on the cross over bridge connected with wireless links and two gateways that are installed inside the traffic police boxes to present the police traffic photography.
